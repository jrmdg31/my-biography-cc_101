                            My mission in life is to live it the way I should with little to no influence of others. My personal legend isn't to achieve a profession
                            that is - I want to live in this world where I know - that I'd leave an impression and contribution. My personal legend is simply to live life with hapiness
                            , does not matter wether that happiness is deep or not. I see life as a precious as it is. I also believe that not everything that happens unto is not always
                            on our control, that is why - we just need to... cope with everything life's throws as. "Maktub" or "it is written" says my favorite book author.

                                        I was born prematurely with cleft palate. As far as I remember - my grandmother told me how I was born. I was born with an abnormality and prematurely. 
                                        This day is one of the saddening day probably for my parents. I remember my grandma telling me this story in which for 72 hours - my heart as a baby would run out of beat
                                        every hour. That is to say, even the best doctors of this hospital couldn't assure that I'd live.

                                        I also got few surgeries to get my palate closed and nose fixed.

                                        I couldn't eat anything other than soft food. The insides of my mouth and nose is open. I am prone to any sickness as even a little dust that enters me - I am back at the hospital again.

                                        At age 5 to 7 I already did have few surgeries in my nose and mouth. A this age I am getting a little broad idea of the world. Though I am sometimes getting bullied because I cannot speak properly
                                        - I dont know what drived me to stay positive all these times. At age 6 to 7 I have learned to read - I found my very first hobby, reading. By the time I was 12 years old I had a quite good vocubulary.
                                        as I get older - i have developed a sense of sadness everytime I was made fun of. As a coping mechanism to the sadness I've felt - I decided to grow as much as I can. To be always be ready to improve as a person.
                                        To always be strong no matter what of conditions im in. It is in this age that I've learned to just figure most of things out by my self, through observance and thinking.

                                        Everyone exeperiences highschool life at some point. But I believe mine is quite exceptional. At Republic Central College's - I found some really good friends in which I am still communicating to them still even if we are now separated.
                                        At this point of my life I have found a very interesting person in which will be mentioned later. I was fortunate enough to made it in the swimming varsity for a year. I also found myself enjoying being academically challenged. 
                                        I was a nerd - at this times, I did nothing but to enjoy it, play with my friends, do some dumb stuffs. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        In the nearing of the end of my 8th grade. The tragedy happened. The pandemic - I was devastated, was separated from my friends, and on top of that - I was tranfered in another school near my hometown, porac.
                                        By then I found it a little bit hard to make friends. All of the other kids does not have the same interest in me - they weren't into gaming and other nerdy stuffs.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        But over time, I did overcome to make new friends and learn new interest. The interest of cycling, it is sports. I rode with some new friends to other provinces, quite fun.

                                      The current me is me. I am kind of able to make friends already - and - is the near of adulthood. Good thing shin's still is by my side. I am currently in college now, taking computer science as a degree - it is not that kind of hard as technology 
                                      actually is one of the hobbies that I've done in the pandemic. I find it very fun, class schedules weren't a full day like highschool.

                                        I have also found reading much interesting now. One book a week, I have broaden my mind in various topics such as technology and other fields that interests me.
